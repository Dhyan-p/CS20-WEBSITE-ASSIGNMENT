            <p>Thor is the Norse God of Thunder and one of Marvel's most powerful superheroes. Based on ancient mythology, he first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1962. Thor comes from Asgard, a realm of gods, and wields the powerful hammer Mjolnir, which grants him control over lightning and storms. His strength, bravery, and nobility make him a natural leader.</p>

            <p>Thor's story often focuses on his journey to become worthy. At the beginning, he is arrogant and reckless, but after being sent to Earth to learn humility, he grows into a wiser and more responsible hero. His experiences on Earth help him understand humanity and shape him into a protector of all realms.</p>

            <p>Thor has faced countless threats, from mythical creatures to cosmic villains. His biggest battles include fighting Loki, the Frost Giants, Hela, and even Thanos.
