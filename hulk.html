            <p>The Hulk, also known as Bruce Banner, is a hero created by a scientific accident. First appearing in 1962, Banner was a brilliant scientist studying gamma radiation. After being exposed to an intense gamma blast, he gained the ability to transform into the Hulk — a massive green creature with unbelievable strength. The transformation is usually triggered by anger or stress.
            </p> 

            <p>The Hulk represents the struggle between control and emotion. Bruce Banner is calm, intelligent, and gentle, while the Hulk is powerful, unstoppable, and sometimes unpredictable. This duality makes the character unique and symbolic of inner conflict. Despite his challenges, the Hulk often fights to protect people from threats that only he is strong enough to face.</p>

            <p>Throughout the comics and movies, the Hulk has battled powerful enemies such as Abomination, Red Hulk, and alien invasions. His strength grows with his anger, making him one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel universe. Even when misunderstood or feared, Hulk continues to prove that he is a hero at heart.</p>

            <p>The Hulk's story is also one of acceptance. Bruce Banner learns to understand and sometimes even cooperate with the Hulk within him. This journey highlights themes of identity, emotion, and strength. Fans admire the Hulk because he shows that even our weaknesses can become our greatest power.</p>
