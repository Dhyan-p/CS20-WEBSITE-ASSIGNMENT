# CS20-WEBSITE-ASSIGNMENT

WEBSITE DESCRIPTION 
For CS20 website assignment, I created a five-page website about the Top 5 Marvel Superheroes. Each page focuses on one hero and includes their picture, background information, and unique story.

EXTRA FOR EXPERTS 
For extra for experts feature, I added interactive-style ability bar (skill bars) to each hero's page. These bars visually show each hero's intelligence, strength, speed, durability, energy projection, and elements with different colors and percentages for each supperhero. The skill bars make the website more dynamic and help the viewer easily compare the heroes' abilities. 

CREDITS
Some of the written content on this website was created with the help of ChatGPT, which assisted in writing the character descriptions and polishing the paragraphs. The ability bar percentages for each hero were inspire using Google open AI to help estimate and organize the power levels.
