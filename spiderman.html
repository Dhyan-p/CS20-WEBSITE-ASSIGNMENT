            <p>Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, is one of the most beloved superheroes in the world. Created in 1962, he quickly became popular because he was a relatable teenager dealing with everyday problems. After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter gained powers such as wall-climbing, super agility, spider-sense, and enhanced strength. His homemade costume and web-shooters show his intelligence and creativity.</p>

            <p>Spider-Man's story emphasizes responsibility. After Peter lost his Uncle Ben, he learned the famous lesson: “With great power comes great responsibility.” This moment shaped his mission to fight crime and help people, even when it made his life harder. Spider-Man protects New York City from villains like the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom.</p>
